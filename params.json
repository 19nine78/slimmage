{"name":"Slimage (SlimImage)","tagline":"Context-friendly responsive image solution","body":"### Overview\r\n\r\nslimage (Slim Image) is focused on full-stack responsive imaging. It requires an [RIAPI-compliant](http://riapi.org) backend to perform on-demand resizing.\r\n\r\nIt is *CSS-friendly** - your sizing logic stays in your CSS files, and you can use media queries.\r\n\r\nIt is **context-aware** - if you're images have 'max-width:100%' but are inside a column, they will be sized to the column width, not the screen width.\r\n\r\nIt is **CDN-smart** - images are sized in intervals of 160px to minimize the number of variants (this comes out to roughly 13 versions, and is configurable).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
